		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3><strong>Netflix</strong>, Los Gatos, CA <em>Nov 2011-Mar 2021</em></h3>
		<p>
			Drove three transformations at Netflix scale through massive growth of the company: 
			Changed how Netflix builds code,
			Distributed security layer processing,
			Coalesced user and device identity across Netflix.

			For each transformation, identified the problem and how it affected the business, defined a strategy to address the problem, rallied support, got the project off the ground, drove the implementation, and found talent to take ownership of the solution. Leveraged my deep understanding of the Netflix architecture to contribute and improve system designs across the stack. Collaborated and cultivated long-term relationships with internal stakeholders, like device teams, client teams, product managers and business development.<br/>
			Coached new team members, guiding them to design and take ownership of vital systems. Challenged team members to achieve their personal career goals.<br/>
		</p>
		<h4>Developer Productivity <em>Oct 2019 - Mar 2021</em></h4>
		<p>Evangelized the opportunities that Serverless could offer engineers.</p>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Built “sidecars” to offer aspects of a Function-as-a-service (FaaS) experience to traditional non-serveless services.</li>
			<li>Bridged AWS Lambda to Netflix infrastructure, e.g. Authenticated identity, logging, metrics.</li>
			<li>Worked on a distributed build system built on top of Docker’s Buildkit, to build updatable immutable images on behalf of users.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Identity and Access Management <em>Jan 2016 - Sep 2019</em></h4>
		<p>Formed and led a team of 4 to consolidate device and user identity across Netflix to address business continuity risk issues. Incubated numerous initiatives that grew into full blown teams.</p>
		<ul class="disc">
            <li>Designed and administered multiple critical systems to be fault tolerant and scalable to ensure 99.999% uptime. Responsible for device booting, device identification, a secure transport layer, and user authentication across every request.</li>
            <li>Distributed and destructured Netflix security protocol at the “edge” in a way to increase insights where it was unavailable before, reduced average latency by 30% and dropped 99th percentile latency by 20% while increasing resilience across all major edge systems at Netflix. </li>
            <li>Modernized HTTP cookie processing to reduce mysterious errant behavior being seen across the fleet, resulting in the reduction of reauthorizations by 18% and a 25% drop in invalid tokens.			</li>
            <li>Captained the transformation of how customer identity was passed around through the Netflix system, increasing insight and adding security. Unified identity across multiple sources (web, devices, partners) to a single Patent-pending representation, while preventing a category of VPPA violating identity mismatch faults. Coordinated migration across dozens of teams.</li>
            <li>Initiated a near-real-time logging out of users to alleviate customer pain and customer support load, from a troublesome 8-hour delayed logging out.</li>
            <li>Performed multiple external partner security integrations, including Google Home integration for identity switching and Comcast device identification, which enabled tens of millions of users to better experience Netflix.</li>
        </ul>
		<h4>Playback Access <em>Apr 2015 - Jan 2016</em></h4>
		<p>Charted a path to be closer to the core of the business, by taking on the domain of digital-rights management (DRM) and operating at “Netflix scale”.</p>
		<ul class="disc">
            <li>Maintained critical systems necessary for secure playback. Created a path to make an unwieldy key legacy monolith system serviceable.</li>
            <li>Operated multiple DRM systems using best practices to keep them resilient.</li>
            <li>Partnered with third-party companies to integrate their DRM and device identity systems.
			</li>
            <li>Engaged with infrastructure teams to keep their internal offering useful and relevant to product developers.</li>
        </ul>
		<h4>Engineering Tools <em>Nov 2011 - Apr 2015</em></h4>
		<p>Started without any experience with build tools, then went on to reshape how server code was built at Netflix for thousands of engineers.</p>
		<ul class="disc">
            <li>Made the bold choice to evolve the build system from a legacy Apache Ant system to the nascent Gradle build system. Oversaw migration of all projects at Netflix to the newer build system. Elevated the Gradle ecosystem by creating dozens of plugins, engaging with the community and speaking at Gradle Summit.</li>
            <li>Took ownership of company-wide dependency management: fixed conflicts, identified problems, administered external dependencies.</li>
            <li>Introduced infrastructure-as-code to the Jenkins project via the job-dsl-plugin, which  modeled Jenkins jobs in a Groovy DSL, allowing the automation of job creation in a space that previously required manual configuration in a UI.</li>
            <li>Created a public presence in the “build” community, by speaking at definitive conferences and meetups. Supported the launch of dozens of Netflix’s OSS offerings.</li>
        </ul>
