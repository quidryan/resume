		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3><strong>Intralinks</strong>, Boston, MA <em>August 2008-Present</em></h3>
		<p>
		Grew into a Team Lead, directing many core features. Pushed new technologies and new ideas
		across multiple organizations. Developed features to support M&A and Life Science verticals,
		while working on horizontal features such as security, tagging, localization, 2 factor 
		authentication, and search. Involved on entire stack, from Apache -> GWT -> Flex -> 
		REST -> Core -> DB. 

		Awarded the 2010 IntraLinks Innovation Award.
		</p>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Standardized and promoted effective developer environments.</li>
			<li>Leveraged Apache to act as central router of requests and cross-server features?</li>
			<li>Retrofitted complicated application entry point from convoluted javascript, 
			JSPs, and servlets  (taking upwards of 20 seconds to load) to GWT-based login 
			application using system’s standard REST which provided a better maintenance story 
			and greatly improved the speed of the application.</li>
			<li>Learned Flex, to better cooperate with UI Developers and to introduce functional
			concepts to Flex codebase.</li>
			<li>Modernized integration tests to validate spring contexts and query against 
			in-memory hsql database. (Away from manual tests against shared dev database). 
			Create spring-magic to auto create mocks of auto-wired dependencies.</li>
			<li>Created Sharpening the Saw sessions to promote cross organizational discussions 
			of tangential concepts (Engines, Testing, Meditation, Electricity)</li>
			<li>Create Spring BeanPostProcessor to detect mis-use of singletons in spring context</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>Sirios Capital Management</strong>, Boston, MA <em>July 2007 - June 2008</em></h3>
		<p>
		Developed Java EE 5 based financial research application for reporting and bookmarking of 
		external services. Coordinated project deadlines and goals.
		</p>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Designed scalable AJAX-enabled web interface to enter new records, query external services, search archived records and to administer accounts. Imported tens of thousands of disparate legacy records.  Queried external financial services using REST and SOAP. Leveraged JBoss Seam to maintain a conversational state and to bind JSF and EJB3 Beans together. Used Hibernate Search to allow JPA entities to be indexed by Lucene.</li>
			<li>Constructed dedicated Java server to automate conversion of Office Documents to PDF. Used JMS to coordinate conversion process.</li>
			<li>Implemented service to reliably consume XML documents out of actively updated FTP server. Used native Windows API to monitor directory. Transformed documents between XML formats, then injected into Lucene-based text search service for querying.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>Cedarpoint Communication</strong>, Derry, NH <em>July 2006 - March 2007</em></h3>
		<p>
		Contracted to modernize and support Element Management System (EMS), built using JBoss Server, JSPs and Struts. Advised group on best practices for scalable multithreaded systems.
		</p>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Investigated AJAX frameworks and introduced the Dojo Toolkit. Offered semantic DHTML/CSS solution to greatly simplify and standardize existing JSP hodgepodge. Provided examples and rewrote existing features to utilize the cleaner solution, which separated business logic from UI formatting logic. Trained group on using newer paradigm of AJAX and JSON.</li>
			<li>Implemented Emergency Call Monitoring feature in SafariView. Involved an EJB service that monitored an event bus. Designed accompanying JSPs to produce the UI using Dojo layout and AJAX for real-time view.</li>
			<li>Integrated sandboxed TCL interpreter into Java-based EMS to safely run legacy TCL scripts.  Designed user interface to manage, configure and schedule scripts.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>Proliphix, Inc</strong>, Westford, MA <em>October 2004 - May 2006</em></h3>
		<p>Responsible for user-facing tools and web applications to support embedded network-enabled thermostat.</p>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Consumer application to reliably upgrade thermostat firmware, and to backup configurations.</li>
			<li>Initiated rewrite of behind-schedule, outsourced management application, to a scalable full-featured PHP 5 solution in a short time frame. Grew public web application to support thousands of active thermostats and users.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><strong>Equipe Communications</strong>, Acton, MA <em>August 2000 - June 2006</em></h3>
		<p>Provided company-wide development support, bringing a multitude of projects to completion in fast paced startup environment.</p>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Pioneered BeanShell-based graphical scripting environment, to test IIOP interfaces in a Java syntax sandbox. Supported its use by engineering, SQA, bulk provisioning, and onsite diagnostics.</li>
			<li>Designed auditing/reporting product to perform large scale audits of customers’ network. Used to visualize inventory, configuration, trends, and “problem areas.”</li>
			<li>Consolidated SQA environment into a single web application. Integrated CORBA management, XML-RPC SUT monitoring, and Adtech traffic generation to provide an end-to-end testing environment.</li>
